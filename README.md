  "group": "Bangla",
  "url": "https://example.com/stream.m3u8"
}
```

### 💻 Usage Example

#### JavaScript
```js
fetch("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SHAJON-404/iptv/refs/heads/main/channels.json")
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data);
  });
```

#### Python
```python
import requests

channels = requests.get(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SHAJON-404/iptv/refs/heads/main/channels.json"
